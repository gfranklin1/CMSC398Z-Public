## Assignments 

### Project 1: **Play Wordle**
**Description:**  
- Implemented a command-line Wordle game in Python.
- Used the `termcolor` library to display colored feedback for each letter:
  - White on green for correct letter and position.
  - White on yellow for correct letter, wrong position (with Wordle-style duplicate handling).
  - White on black for incorrect letters.
- Accepted the answer word as a command-line argument.
- Validated user guesses for length and alphabetic characters.
- Allowed up to 6 attempts per game.
- Congratulated the user on a correct guess, or revealed the answer after 6 unsuccessful tries.
- **The entire project was written using Copilot coaching mode as an introduction to AI Agents; I did not write any code myself.**
